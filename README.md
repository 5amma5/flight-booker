# README

This is part of the Advanced Forms and Active Records section in The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails Curriculum. Find the project instructions [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flight-booker).


# Final Thoughts

The purpose of the project was to help apply recent learning on nested forms. The instructions didn't require important things such as validations and CSS. These should be first priority if I want to improve upon it down the road.
